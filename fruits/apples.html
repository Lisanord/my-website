            <h2>Generally</h2>
            <p>Store apples on the counter at room temperature if you plan to use them within a few days. 
                Keep them in a cool, dry spot away from direct sunlight to maintain their freshness.
                For long-term storage, place apples in the refrigerator, which helps slow down the ripening 
                process and extends their shelf life. Alternatively, if you have a basement or a root cellar, 
                store them there. That environment keeps apples fresh for weeks or even months, depending on the variety.
