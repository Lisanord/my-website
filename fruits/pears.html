            <h2>Generally</h2>
            <p>Store pears on the counter at room temperature to allow them to ripen naturally. 
                Keep them in a cool, dry spot away from direct sunlight and check them daily for signs of 
                ripening, such as a slight softness near the stem and a sweet aroma. 
                Once pears are ripe, transfer them to the refrigerator to preserve their freshness and slow down 
                the ripening process. You can store them loose in the crisper drawer or place them in a paper bag, 
                which helps maintain their moisture and texture while keeping them cool for a few extra days.
