            <p>Some fruits and vegetables should not be stored together.
             Certain items release ethylene gas - a natural
                compund that speeds up ripening. Others are sensitive
                to it and spoil faster when nearby. This guide helps you
                figure out what to store together, what to keep apart
                and how to make the most of small kitchen spaces.

            <h3>Conclution</h3>
            <p>Not all fruits and vegetables get along when stored together—some give off natural
                    gases that can make others ripen (or spoil) faster. For the best results, try to 
                    keep sensitive produce apart from ethylene produsers.
                    But don't stress if space is tight! Storing items in containers, bags, or separate
                    compartments can help reduce their impact on each other—even if they share a shelf. 
                    Do what works best for your kitchen, and use this guide as a helpful starting point, 
                    not a strict rulebook. </p>
